Redirects the main feed and optionally the comments feed seamlessly and
transparently to Feedburner.com.

== Description ==

Redirects the main feed and optionally the comments feed to Feedburner.com. It
does this seamlessly without the need to modify templates, setup new hidden
feeds, modify .htaccess files, or asking users to migrate to a new feed.  All
existing feeds simply become Feedburner feeds seamlessly and transparently for
all users. Just tell the plugin what your Feedburner feed URL is and you're
done.

== Installation ==

1. Copy fdfeedburner.php into wp-content/plugins
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure your feed from the new Feedburner submenu
