== Description ==

**Create Surveys** for WordPress.

**[Download now!](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-surveys.zip)**

Inspired by the groundwork of [Survey Fly](http://plugins.starkware.net/?p=10), which it was previously inspired by [Instinct Entertainment's Survey Creator Plugin](http://www.instinct.co.nz/?p=11).

That give me the base to do these modifications and have a new great plug-in! Thanks out to them for letting me use their code.

Some features:

* Create, modify and retire surveys.
* Up to ten answer option with horizontal, vertical and dropdown-menu alignment.
* Backward compatibility with [Polyglot](http://fredfred.net/skriker/index.php/polyglot/) plugin.
* Spanish and Basque localization.

== Installation ==

Upload files to your plugin directory and activate within WordPress.
You can manage surveys by adding new surveys, and then adding questions and answer options.
The single active survey will show up in the Page or Post where you place the text: [wp_surveys]
