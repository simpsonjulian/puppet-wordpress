Showcase your Top Posts with the PostRank widget, track social media analytics, and engage with your readers from the WP dashboard.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the PostRank [Top Posts Widget & Analytics](http://www.postrank.com/publishers/wordpress) to your blog. PostRank measures the audience [engagement with each story](http://www.postrank.com/postrank#what) by analyzing the types and frequency of online social media interactions -- comments, tweets, diggs, etc. The more interesting or relevant the story is, the more active your readers will be in organizing, responding to, and sharing it.

The Top Posts Widget enables readers to easily see the blog's best content, with the highest overall [PostRank scores](http://www.postrank.com/postrank/). Readers can also search for the best content by specific topics of interest. The Analytics Dashboard integrates specific social social hub analytics metrics in-line with each post, or an overview of the blog's engagement for the last 30 days.

By measuring the engagement with each story the PostRank Top Posts Widget features your best new and archived content, providing another channel to gain readership, increase page views and clicks, RSS subscriptions and ad revenues.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is PostRank, how does it work? =
Great question, take a look at our [indepth description on postrank.com](http://www.postrank.com/postrank).

PostRank scoring is based on analysis of the "5 Cs" of engagement: [creating, critiquing, chatting, collecting, and clicking](http://www.postrank.com/postrank#how). By collecting interaction metrics from around the internet our system calculates the overall engagement score of each story and a PostRank value is determined.

== Template Tags ==
This plugin offers several custom theme template tags, so you can integrate PostRanks into your WordPress theme.  They can all be called from within [The Loop](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop), or you can pass them a specific post id.
There are currently three template tags:
= the_postrank_badge(post_id) =
This template tag displays a nicely formatted PostRank badge.

Example: `<?php the_postrank_badge(); ?>`
= the_postrank(post_id) =
This template tag displays the numerical PostRank of a post.  Since it only displays a number, you can format it to your liking.

Example: `<?php the_postrank(); ?>`
= the_postrank_color(post_id) =
This template tag displays the CSS color code for the PostRank of a post.  It displays a string like 'ffe08e'.

Example: `<div style="background-color:#<?php the_postrank_color(); ?>;">`
