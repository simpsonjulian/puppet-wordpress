== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the frequently asked questions for Calendar? =

   They are located on the [KJO Web Services forum](http://forum.kjowebservices.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=10 "KJO Web Services forum")

= Where can I get support for the plugin? =

   Support via e-mail became too much of a burden and the lack of e-mail 
   notifications made monitoring the WordPress forums impossible. There 
   is now a support area for Calendar on the [KJO Web Services forum](http://forum.kjowebservices.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=13 "KJO Web Services forum") 
   which will be monitored and is the only official place to get support for Calendar.

= Can I remove the link to your company? =
   
   Yes, you may do this, but please only do so if you absolutely have to (for 
   instance if you are using Calendar for a business site). Calendar is 
   popular and the business we get from users of Calendar deciding to comission 
   web work is what allows us to continue to provide Calendar free and open source.
