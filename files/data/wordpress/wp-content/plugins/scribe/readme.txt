== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Scribe on multiple WordPress sites? =

Yes, you may install the plugin on multiple sites AND each site may use the same API key. We do not limit the number of sites, only the number of content evaluations performed per month.

= Why do I need an API Key? =

The API key is used to regulate the number of content evaluations provided by our service to each user. We have multiple pricing tiers, including a FREE "test drive" tier, based on the amount of analysis performed within your blog. 

= Why does Scribe require a theme or plugin in order to work? =

Scribe relies on the SEO features of some of the more popular SEO frameworks. Our currently supported frameworks listed in the Installation area represent platforms in WordPress that have been tested and support the advanced SEO features required to maximize your exposure on search engines.

= How is Scribe different from other SEO tools? =

Scribe is unique because it focuses on the content of your site and not just the structure of the site. As all SEO experts acknowledge, great SEO **starts** with great content. By using Scribe you will ensure that your content meets the best practices for content structure **and** that search engines can easily identify your keywords/concepts.

In essence, Scribe allows writers to perform effective search engine optimization with little effort and no mystery.

= I don't see my theme listed! = 

We will continue to support other themes over time based on the cooperation of theme developers. Because our plugin is under the GPL, you may modify it to support other \themes. Ask your WordPress development team to review the \scribe\resources\ecordia.js, \scribe\scribe.php, and \scribe\views\settings.php files for ways to include your theme. Or contact Nick at [http://plugin-developer.com](http://plugin-developer.com "Excellent WordPress Developer") for a quote.

== Search Engine Optimization ==

The Search Engine Optimization (SEO) process can generally be defined as four key parts; content, keywords, site structure and links. Most SEO activity focuses on one or all of these areas. 

Scribe is designed to help authors/writers participate in the SEO process through the intelligent review and analysis of the content on the page. 

First, we review the structure of the content. Next, we review the semantic structure of the document to find the most relevant keyword terms based on search behavior and identify how you can better use these terms within your content. Finally we score the content and provide an overview of how well you are meeting SEO best practices for content organization.

Scribe makes SEO copywriting easy. Try it for yourself.
